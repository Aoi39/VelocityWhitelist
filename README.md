# VelocityWhitelist
Are you using Velocity and tired of setting up whitelists for each server?  
Then you can set up a whitelist on Velocity side.  
This plugin makes it easy to proceed with that setup.

## Features
- Simple and easy to understand commands.
- Save the whitelist in the same format as vanilla. (You can use your previously used whitelist.json without modification!)
- Customize the message displayed to players who are not on the white list.
- Can notify you that a player who is not on the whitelist has tried to connect.

## Commands
- **velocitywhitelist add <PlayerName>**
> Adding a player to whitelist
- **velocitywhitelist remove <PlayerName>**
> Removing a player from whitelist
- **velocitywhitelist on**
> Enable whitelist(After rebooting, config file settings will be used)
- **velocitywhitelist off**
> Disable whitelist(After rebooting, config file settings will be used)
- **velocitywhitelist list**
> Displays a list of players on the whitelist.
- **velocitywhitelist reload**
> Reload the white list file. (No point in using this unless you have made changes to the file directly)

## Aliases
The "**velocitywhitelist**" portion of the above command list can be replaced with these.
- velocitywhitelist
- velowhitelist
- vwhitelist
- vw

1. Download this plugin.
2. Move (or copy) the plugin to the plugins folder of Velocity.
